Indian Sign Language Recognition(Matlab)

This project uses Matlabs Image Processing Toolbox, Computer Vision Toolbox, Image Acquisition Toolbox to detect Indian
Sign language charecters (A-Z) shown through a webcam. A customized neural network built using the Neural Networks toolbox 
is trained using samples given in the test folder. The knowlegde gained is used to detect gestures in real time.
